1. Get rid of cards :)

2. Switch to Extending the base user instead of One2One Field. seems less cluncky. Or link everything back to account


3. Password Change
    - I will give them a password and they will update it the first time the login

4. Pop up that "Are you sure you want to submit bet"
    - Show all odds, bet amounts, win amounts and total
    - Add parlay total

5. Validate Bet with JS
    - On Form Submit:
        - Check to see if they have enough funds in their account (Set Account Balance in Session?)

6. Switch from first half to second half. Make it Tabbed?? :)

7. Front page with highlighted games. :)

8. Improve admin
    - Total handle
    - Sort events
    - Search event for Odds

9. Solidify Bet Creation
    - Double Check that risk * divider = win on Submit bet
    - Make sure they don't have an active bet with that odd already to get over the limit

10. Update bets
    - The Values for Placed Bet and Bet Values do not add up.
    - Need to check Parley logic with pushes
     --- Think this is fixed ---
